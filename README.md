# TEXT BASED RPG - MY MEDIEVAL LIFE

This project idea my medieval life was brougt to life by my desire to not only learn web development but to also learn game development, i am an avid gamer so i thought it would be a good opportunity for me to combine two passions.

My medieval life hopes that it will give a good experience with a different type of game, it also aims for people to get in contact with new ideas to help further develop the game in the future with features that others may like to see.

The intended audience for this project are as follows:

* Young adults
* Adults that like games
* Teen
* anyone that likes games set in medieval times

Here is the link to my [live site](https://nap199i.github.io/Text-based-RPG/).  
Here's the [am i responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://nap199i.github.io/Text-based-RPG) site for my project.

## UX

My UX process was again to go through a microsoft document that I have made previously, it takes me through the five planes of UX. I also had to really think about what would be important to me as the owner, operator, developer and as a user, my goal for the site was to decide who i would want to use it, what the purpose of the site was, the color schemes, what i wanted for the initial release and things that I may want to add in later releases.

### Colour Scheme

The idea behind the color scheme used was wanting to use red, green and white the colors on the welsh flag however I had to use some other colors also for text and social icons to make the scheme work.

- `#000000` used for primary text and content titles.
- `#ed1d23` used for nav and footer backgrounds and inside social icons.
- `#219b54` used for the background color of the buttons.
- `#66c08b` used for the hover effect color of the buttons.
- `#C39678` used for the background container circle of the social icons.
- `#c4b0a3` used for the hover effect on the background container circle of the social icons.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-ed1d23-219b54-66c08b-c39678-c4b0a3) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

The reason i picked these fonts again was because I believe they give a professional and clean look to the site once used.

- [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville?query=libre) was used for the main titles on each page and game titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=robo) was used for the sub heading on the main page.

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary text throughout the site.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

To help with this section, what I planned for the site admin goals and different user goals have been shown below.

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to know what the site is, so that I can make a decision on whether i want to continue to engage with the site.
- As a new site user, I would like to know what i can do on the site, so that I can go and do it.
- As a new site user, I would like to contact the administration, so that I can ask any questions I may have, report any bugs or give any ideas to help improve the site.
- As a new site user, I would like to find out how to play, so that I can play the game.

### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to find the game, so that I can play a different story line.
- As a returning site user, I would like to contact the administration, so that I can ask any questions I may have, report any bugs or give any ideas to help improve the site.

### Site Admin

- As a site administrator, I should be able to access the page code, so that I can update and add new content.
- As a site administrator, I should be able to recieve and answer queries by email, so that I can assist anyone with any questions or ideas.

## Mockups

I've used [Affinity 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) to design my site Mockups, I own the software but the link will take you to their site.

## Features

The website consists of the following pages:  
* Home page
* How to play - part of the home page
* Game page
* contact page 
* confirmation page 

There will be a breakdown of each pages features in order below

### Existing Features

- **Feature #1 - Nav bar**

    - The nav bar is a helpful navigation feature displayed clearly at the top of each page to give the user easy navigation controls for the site, this benefits the site because it makes all areas easily accessible, the nav bar items also change their position as the screen gets smaller and finally when you hover over an element of the nav bar it gives the user clear feedback as seen in the screenshots below.
