# TEXT BASED RPG - MY MEDIEVAL LIFE

This project idea my medieval life was brougt to life by my desire to not only learn web development but to also learn game development, i am an avid gamer so i thought it would be a good opportunity for me to combine two passions.

My medieval life hopes that it will give a good experience with a different type of game, it also aims for people to get in contact with new ideas to help further develop the game in the future with features that others may like to see.

The intended audience for this project are as follows:

* Young adults
* Adults that like games
* Teen
* anyone that likes games set in medieval times

Here is the link to my [live site](https://nap199i.github.io/Text-based-RPG/).  
Here's the [am i responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://nap199i.github.io/Text-based-RPG) site for my project.

## UX

My UX process was again to go through a microsoft document that I have made previously, it takes me through the five planes of UX. I also had to really think about what would be important to me as the owner, operator, developer and as a user, my goal for the site was to decide who i would want to use it, what the purpose of the site was, the color schemes, what i wanted for the initial release and things that I may want to add in later releases.

### Colour Scheme

The idea behind the color scheme used was wanting to use red, green and white the colors on the welsh flag however I had to use some other colors also for text and social icons to make the scheme work.

- `#000000` used for primary text and content titles.
- `#ed1d23` used for nav and footer backgrounds and inside social icons.
- `#219b54` used for the background color of the buttons.
- `#66c08b` used for the hover effect color of the buttons.
- `#C39678` used for the background container circle of the social icons.
- `#c4b0a3` used for the hover effect on the background container circle of the social icons.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-ed1d23-219b54-66c08b-c39678-c4b0a3) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/readme/color-palette.png)

### Typography

The reason i picked these fonts again was because I believe they give a professional and clean look to the site once used.

- [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville?query=libre) was used for the main titles on each page and game titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=robo) was used for the sub heading on the main page.

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary text throughout the site.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

To help with this section, what I planned for the site admin goals and different user goals have been shown below.

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to know what the site is, so that I can make a decision on whether i want to continue to engage with the site.
- As a new site user, I would like to know what i can do on the site, so that I can go and do it.
- As a new site user, I would like to contact the administration, so that I can ask any questions I may have, report any bugs or give any ideas to help improve the site.
- As a new site user, I would like to find out how to play, so that I can play the game.

### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to find the game, so that I can play a different story line.
- As a returning site user, I would like to contact the administration, so that I can ask any questions I may have, report any bugs or give any ideas to help improve the site.

### Site Admin

- As a site administrator, I should be able to access the page code, so that I can update and add new content.
- As a site administrator, I should be able to recieve and answer queries by email, so that I can assist anyone with any questions or ideas.

## Mockups

## Features

The website consists of the following pages:  
* Home page
* How to play - part of the home page
* Game page
* contact page 
* confirmation page 

There will be a breakdown of each pages features in order below

### Existing Features

- **Feature #1 - Nav bar**

    - The nav bar is a helpful navigation feature displayed clearly at the top of each page to give the user easy navigation controls for the site, this benefits the site because it makes all areas easily accessible, the nav bar items also change their position as the screen gets smaller and finally when you hover over an element of the nav bar it gives the user clear feedback as seen in the screenshots below.

Small screen nav bar

- **Feature #2 hero image, title and start button on home page**

    - Here we have a nice hero image displaying a medieval castle whith a clear concise title making sure the user knows where they are and what the site is about, there is also a large start button ensuring users know how to start the game therefore benefiting the users experience and the sites usability.

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/homepage.png)

- **Feature #3 footer icons**

    - The footer icons are part of the footer which lets the user know that they have come to the end of the page, the icons themselfs are links to social medias for if they wish to connect in other ways with the site, once the icons have been hovered over they give a feedback to let the user know that they are hovering and the site is registering their movements giving them feedback for a good user experience which also benefits the sites usability and credability.

This is the regular footer with the social icons displayed:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/reg-footer.png)  

This is the footer with the hover effect applied so you can see the feedback the user would get when they hover, the effect is applied to the facebook icon on the left:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/footersocialhover.png)

- **Feature #4 how to play**

    - The how to play section is not its own page this is an off canvas box that enters and exits the screen on the left hand side, on mobile it covers the entire screen.
    This has been kept to plain black text on a white background for ease of readability and to be kept simple so as not to overwhelm any user.
    The how to play has a close button with the normal fearutes as the others as outlined in the above features, this is the only aspect that has not been kept to black and white.

This is the how to play window once opened:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/howtoplay.png)

- **Feature #5 contact form**

    - On the contact form we have the contact header as a call to action, I have set the name, email and message to required so we know who is getting in contact, a way to contact them back to answer the query and the message so there is something to answer. Finally I set the submit button to give feedback on hover as all the others on the site, I also set the submit button to disable once the message has been successfully sent as it takes a couple of seconds for the site to process the api request and act accordingly, this all benefits the user so they dont accidentally send the query unfinished and so they know the site is registering their movements for a good user experience, it benefits the site so there is not incomplete messages sent.  

The full contact form:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/full-contact.png)

The name required showing:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/name-required.png)

The email required showing:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/email-req.png)

The message required showing:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/message-req.png)

The submit button disabled:  

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/submit-dis.png)

- **Feature #6 confirmation**

    - The confirmation of submission page is a nice feature for a good user experience, letting the user know that the submission has been successful, how long is needed before they get a response and helping them get back to the main site automatically or through a link.

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/confirmation.png)  

- **Feature #7 confirmation automatic redirect**

    - The automatic redirect is a good feature for user experience again due to the message being displayed and the user not having to do anything to get back to the main site.

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/auto-redirect-code.jpg)

- **Feature #8 automatic ten second countdown**

    - The automatic countdown is a good feature for user experience again due to the message being displayed and the user being able to see how long there is until their redirect so they can see that the function is working, to see this in action for yourself I have included a link to the [confirmation-page](https://nap199i.github.io/Text-based-RPG/confirmation.html).

![screenshot](documentation/readme/features/countdown-code.jpg)

- **Feature #9 The game**

    - The game has a different title for every selection which has to do with the path the user has taken, this reinforces the choice they made helping for a good user experience, the main text is black text on a white background to help readability and the buttons for the choices give the same feedback as every other button on the site as featured above.

screenshot of two different titles:

### Future Features

For future features I do have a couple if ideas that I will list below, these havent been implemented yet for a few reasons, these being:  
* viability
* lack of knowledge / skill
* keeping the site simple for release

- feature #1 a login specific for each user so a sign up / in page
    - If I can implement a login the game could then have a list of members which ties into another future feature, this was not implemented due to my lack of skill and knowledge in this area. 

- feature #2 a function for the game to remember each users specific progress
    - If I can implement this feature I think I would need a login so the site could recall specific user progress, this was not implemented due to my lack of skill and knowledge in this area. 

- feature #3 expand the game from just a story to having items shops fights, life bars and experience bars.
    - Once I have finished off each story path to the end I would like to implement other features like buying and selling items to shops, a life bar for fights and an experience bar for players leveling up their character, this was not implemented due to my lack of skill and knowledge in this area.
